Adjusted location information for populations of Centaurea diffusa

Adjusted location and collection information for populations of native and invasive Centaurea diffusa (diffuse knapweed) used in the experimental PCA and occurrence PCA, originally collected for:

Turner KG, Hufbauer RA, Rieseberg LH (2014) Rapid evolution of an invasive weed. New Phytologist, 202, 309–321.

This data was used to obtain bioclimatic information from WorldClim.org. Due to the size of the grid used in the WorldClim.org data, in some casese it was necessary to adjust the coordinates of some populations located near large bodies of water, to obtain climate data. This file includes these altered coordinates.

File does not include row names.

Column headings are largely spelled out, abbreviations below.
Pop = population ID
Latitude (decimal degrees)
Longitude (decimal degrees)
Origin = status of population, either native ("nat") or invasive ("inv")
