Bioclimatic data and PCA values for experimental populations of Centaurea diffusa

Geographic and climatic information for 14 sampled populations of native and invasive Centaurea diffusa (diffuse knapweed). Also, first three principal components from an analysis of this data. File includes row names, identical to first column, Pop.

Column headings are largely spelled out, abbreviations below.
Pop = population ID
alt = Altitude (m)
bio1 through bio19 = 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim.org current dataset 
Latitude (decimal degrees)
Longitude (decimal degrees)
Origin = status of population, either native ("nat") or invasive ("inv")
PC1 through PC3 = prinicpal components from analysis of this data, excluding origin and longitude.
