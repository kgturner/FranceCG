Trait data for experimental populations of Centaurea diffusa, repeated measures.

Trait values measured in common field experiment in Montpellier, France, 2011. File also include the first three principal components from the experimental PCA of the bioclimatic data for these populations.

Each individual represented by several rows of data, one for each measuring date. Some data in this file is duplicated in FrTraitClimDat_cline.txt and FrEnd_Cline.txt. File contains row numbers.

Column headings are largely spelled out, abbreviations below.
Pop = population ID
Origin = status of population, either native ("nat") or invasive ("inv")
Latitude (decimal degrees)
Longitude (decimal degrees)
Row = location in field experiment
Column = location in field experiment
Trt = Treatment, either water addition ("control") or water limitation ("drought")
Mom = maternal plant ID, seed collected from field
tagged = plant ID, blindly assigned
Bolt.date = experimental day on which plant was observed to have bolted, i.e. produced a flowering stalk
BoltedatH = whether or not a plant had bolted by the end of the experiment ("Yes" or "No")
MaxBoltHtH = height of bolting stem when plant was harvested. If multiple bolting stems were present, then the height of the tallest.
Rose.AreaH.m2 = rosette area of plant at harvest (m2; Max.Rose.daimH X Min.Rose.diamH)
CrownDiam.mm = root crown diameter of plant at harvest (mm)
Shoot.mass.gH = dry weithg of above ground biomass at harvest (g)
bolt.bin = BoltedatH in binary form (yes = 1; no = 0)
time = measuring time point, either 1, 2, or 3 (aka harvest) 
m.date = experimental day plant was measured
lfl = length of longest leaf at m.date (cm)
lfw = width of longest leaf at m.date (cm)
lfc = number of leaves >3 cm in length at m.date
rd = maximum rosette diameter at m.date(m) 
alt = Altitude (m)
PC1 through PC3 = principal components from analysis of the bioclimatic data for these populations, excluding origin and longitude.
