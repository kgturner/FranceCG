Trait data for experimental populations of Centaurea diffusa, measured at harvest

Trait values measured in common field experiment in Montpellier, France, 2011. File also include the first three principal components from the experimental PCA of the bioclimatic data for these populations.

Each individual represent by one row of data in this file. File contains row numbers. Some data in this file is duplicated in FrTraitClimDat_cline_long.txt and FrEnd_Cline.txt.

Column headings are largely spelled out, abbreviations below.
Pop = population ID
Origin = status of population, either native ("nat") or invasive ("inv")
Latitude (decimal degrees)
Longitude (decimal degrees)
Row = location in field experiment
Column = location in field experiment
Trt = Treatment, either water addition ("control") or water limitation ("drought")
Mom = maternal plant ID, seed collected from field
tagged = plant ID, blindly assigned
m1.date = experimental day of first size measurement. For water limitation treatment plants, this date marks the beginning of treatment.
Bolt.date = experimental day on which plant was observed to have bolted, i.e. produced a flowering stalk
Harvest.date = experimental day above ground biomass was harvested. Harvest occurred when a plant had bolted, but not yet flowered, or at the end of the experiment, day 117.
BoltedatH = whether or not a plant had bolted by the end of the experiment ("Yes" or "No")
MaxBoltHtH = height of bolting stem when plant was harvested. If multiple bolting stems were present, then the height of the tallest.
Max.Rose.diamH = rosette maximum diameter of plant when harvested (m)
Min.Rose.diamH = rosette minimum diameter of plant when harvested (m)
Rose.AreaH.m2 = rosette area of plant at harvest (m2; Max.Rose.daimH X Min.Rose.diamH)
CrownDiam.mm = root crown diameter of plant at harvest (mm)
Shoot.mass.gH = dry weithg of above ground biomass at harvest (g)
bolt.bin = BoltedatH in binary form (yes = 1; no = 0)
alt = Altitude (m)
PC1 through PC3 = principal components from analysis of the bioclimatic data for these populations, excluding origin and longitude.
